This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## ShadCN Components & Documentation

Refer to the [ShadCN UI Documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) for component usage, installation, and configuration.

To install a new component into the `components/ui` directory:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest install <component>
```
